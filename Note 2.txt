Grouping in Pandas


To group data in pandas, we use the groupby method. 

The groupby method takes in a column name as its first parameter.

The method returns a dataframe groupby object which itself cannot be viewed.
A data frame groupby object is made of multiple series groupby objects.



Say there's a column named neighbourhood, and the neighbourhood has values such as:
	
	Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, etc...

After the groupby, select a column then select the function you want to perform on said column.

To see the a single groupby result, we use the get_group method and pass one of the neighbourhood as its first argument.

	neighbour_grp = df.groupby('neighbourhood', as_index=False)
	neighbour_grp.get_group('Queens')


To see the all the values based on the group column, use the count method
	
	neighbour_grp.count()


To access a series groupby column, do:
	
	neighbour_grp['COLUMN_NAME']



There's some computation functions we can use for groupby column.

	neighbour_grp['COLUMN_NAME'].min()
	neighbour_grp['COLUMN_NAME'].max()
	neighbour_grp['COLUMN_NAME'].mean()
	neighbour_grp['COLUMN_NAME'].median()
	neighbour_grp['COLUMN_NAME'].std()
	neighbour_grp['COLUMN_NAME'].sum()

Using these functions on the dataframe groupby will give very strange results.
It is suggested to use them on a specific column instead.
The return value of these functions is a series with the groupby target as the index.

To make a dataframe out of a groupby:
	
	gb = neighbour_grp['COLUMN_NAME'].sum()
	gb = gb.reset_index()



Using the agg() method, we can apply multiple computation functions on a single column.

	neighbour_grp['COLUMN_NAME'].agg( ['min', 'max'] )

The agg method takes in a list of function names we want to apply.




	





To combine dataframes, there's multiple methods we can use.

	pd.merge()
	
	df.merge()
	df.join()

pd.merge() is a higher order function which takes in the dataframes that
you want to merge.
	
	pd.merge(df_prices, df_houses)


merge can do anything than join can.
